## Binocularity.org - Free Stereo Camera Calculator
This is a recreated stereobase calculator originally developed by Prof. Nick Holliman for binocularity.org.
This calculator is widely regarded as one of the most effective tools for stereobase calculations among stereographer.
The previous version of website can only be accessed through archive.org.
I believe I'm not the only one who was trying to find this gem.
I was fortunate to recover this calculator from an archived backup, as the original file is now very difficult to find online.
