## Binocularity.org - Free Stereo Camera Calculator
This is a recreated stereobase calculator originally developed by Dr. Nick Holliman for binocularity.org.
The original website is no longer active and can only be accessed through archive.org.
This calculator is widely regarded as one of the most effective tools for stereobase calculations.  
I was fortunate to recover this calculator from an archived backup, as the original file is now very difficult to find online.
